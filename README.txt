This is just a 2d graphing device.
This allows you to input very basic 2d equations and have them output onto the command line. 
Change the size of the grid by updating the xSize and Ysize variables.
Choose an option (0-3) depending on which equation you wish to use.
Enter inputs for the numbers. 
Watch the graph be output onto the screen. Its like Desmos if Desmos was completely useless. You're welcome.
If you wanted to change the ascii of the graph you can update some variables (line , background)
